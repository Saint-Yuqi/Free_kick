I think one simple way to reduce the number of interaction tests between rays and triangles, is to only do interaction tests with triangles
where the normal of the triangle points in the opposite [0, 90Â°[ direction of the ray.
Because if the normal points in the same direction of the ray, then the ray will never hit the "visible" side of the triangle.
This can be simply done with a dot product between the normalised ray and normalised normal of the triangle and if the dot product is bigger or equal than zero,
ignore the interaction.

But one needs to be careful with glass objects!!!!! 
This approach would ignore triangles which are on the backside and thus no refraction would happen.

I think this setting can be configured as a hyperparameter and whether to ignore same directed normals should be configurable by object.
